# Information Model and Terminology Binding

The use of SNOMED CT for recording Allergy, Hypersensitivity, and Intolerance requires the definition of an information model and terminology bindings. This will ensure that the information is captured in a consistent and standardized way, which can be used to facilitate better communication and decision-making between healthcare providers. Furthermore, it will enable the sharing of health information between different systems and facilitate better analysis of health data. By defining an information model and terminology bindings, healthcare organizations can ensure that their data is accurately recorded and can be used in a meaningful way.

The use of HL7® FHIR® with SNOMED CT has gained considerable momentum in recent years, and HL7 FHIR has therefore been selected as the preferred information model in this guide. The following pages will discuss recommended approaches for binding SNOMED to HL7 FHIR for documenting Allergies, Hypersensitivity, and Intolerance in the EHR.
